# Real production secrets must be provided via your deployment environment's secret management
# (e.g. Cloudflare Wrangler `wrangler secret put` / dashboard), not via this file or other committed env files.

# Production database default - override via environment variables or .env.local for local development.
# Do not store real production secrets in this file.

# Cloudflare Turnstile - placeholder values only.
# Get your keys from https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile
# In production (e.g. Cloudflare Workers), configure real keys via secrets / environment variables
# such as `wrangler secret put`, not in .env.production or .env.local.
# Leave empty to disable Turnstile verification (or set to test keys for development).
